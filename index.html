                One Direction, often shortened to 1D, are an English-Irish pop boy band formed in London, England in
                2010. The group are composed of Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson; former member
                Zayn Malik departed from the group in March 2015. The group signed with Simon Cowell's record label Syco
                Records after forming and finishing third in the seventh series of the British televised singing
                competition The X Factor in 2010.
                <br><br>
                Propelled to global success by social media, One Direction's five albums, Up All Night (2011),
                Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013), Four (2014), and Made in the A.M. (2015), topped charts
                in most major markets, and generated hit singles including "What Makes You Beautiful" (their first
                number one on the UK Singles Chart, and the highest debut for a British act on the US Billboard Hot 100
                since 1998), "Live While We're Young", "Best Song Ever", "Story of My Life" and "Drag Me Down". After
                the release of Four, One Direction became the first band in the US Billboard 200 history to have their
                first four albums debut at number one. Their third album, Midnight Memories, was the best-selling
                album worldwide of 2013.
                <br><br>
                Considered teen idols, One Direction were often subject to fan hysteria. They embarked on four
                world tours, two of which were all-stadium. The band's Where We Are Tour, in support of Midnight
                Memories, was the highest-grossing concert tour in 2014, the highest-grossing tour by a vocal group in
                history, and the 15th highest-grossing concert tour of all time, grossing $290.2 million (unadjusted for
                inflation). The band went on hiatus in January 2016, allowing all members to pursue other
                projects.
                <br><br>
                As of 2020, the band have sold a total of 70 million records worldwide, making them one of the
                best-selling boy bands of all time. The band have won nearly 200 awards, including seven Brit
                Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, six Billboard Music Awards, seven American Music Awards (including
                Artist of the Year in 2014 and 2015), and 28 Teen Choice Awards. In 2013, they earned an estimated $75
                million, becoming the second highest earning celebrity under 30 according to Forbes. As the world's
                best-selling artist of 2013, the group was named the Global Recording Artist of the Year by the
                International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. In 2014, Billboard named the band "Artist of
                the Year". Forbes ranked them as the fourth highest-earning celebrities in the world in
                2015, and second in 2016.
